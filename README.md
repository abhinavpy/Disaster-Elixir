# Rescue operation and Resource Distribution-CodeFunDo++

The aim is to build an android app for use by rescue and relief organisations during natural disasters. It helps with the distribution of limited resources until rescue ops are completed. 

## Problems being addressed

* Optimisation of rescue operation of people stranded in case of earthquakes or floods which hinders their mobility.
* Optimisation of distribution of limited basic resources until the rescue operation is completed.

## Approach

1) Obtaining data of people stranded from themselves or relatives
2) Sending in air support to drop supplies alongside the rescue operations to ensure common well-being
3) The air support will also try to reach out to places which we have inadequate data about and help improve our picture of the exact requirements to decide the next steps to be taken
